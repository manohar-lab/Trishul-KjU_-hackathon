  <h1>About TRISHUL</h1>

  <p>
    TRISHUL is an intelligent fraud detection prototype built to combat
    modern, coordinated financial fraud. Unlike traditional systems that
    analyze transactions in isolation, TRISHUL models the entire transaction
    ecosystem as a connected graph.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Financial fraud has evolved beyond simple rule violations.
    Fraudsters operate in groups, distribute activity across multiple
    accounts, and exploit delays in detection systems.
    TRISHUL was designed to address this gap by focusing on
    relationships, patterns, and context.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology Behind TRISHUL</h2>
  <p>
    At its core, TRISHUL uses <b>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</b>
    to analyze transaction networks and uncover hidden multi-hop
    relationships that indicate coordinated fraud.
    To complement detection, <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b>
    provides human-readable explanations enriched with historical context.
  </p>

  <h2>What Makes TRISHUL Different</h2>
  <p>
    ✔ Relationship-first fraud detection instead of rule-based checks<br>
    ✔ Reduced false positives through contextual graph reasoning<br>
    ✔ Explainable alerts to support analyst trust and auditability<br>
    ✔ Designed for real-time and high-volume transaction environments
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>
    TRISHUL is designed for financial institutions, fintech platforms,
    and security teams that require scalable, explainable, and
    adaptive fraud detection systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This project serves as a functional prototype demonstrating the
    feasibility of combining graph intelligence and generative AI
    for next-generation fraud detection.
