  <h1>The TRISHUL Solution</h1>
  <p>
    TRISHUL is a unified fraud detection platform that combines
    <b>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</b> and
    <b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b>
    to detect, explain, and prevent complex financial fraud in real time.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Traditional Systems Fail</h2>
  <p>
    Rule-based fraud systems analyze transactions in isolation.
    Modern fraud, however, is coordinated — involving multiple accounts,
    rapid micro-transactions, and hidden relationship patterns that
    traditional approaches fail to capture.
  </p>

  <h2>How TRISHUL Works</h2>
  <p>
    TRISHUL models the financial ecosystem as a dynamic graph, where
    accounts are nodes and transactions are edges. This allows the system
    to reason over relationships instead of single events.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Pipeline</h2>
  <p>
    <b>1. Ingest</b><br>
    Real-time transaction streams are continuously ingested and converted
    into a graph structure representing account interactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>2. Analyze</b><br>
    Graph Neural Networks analyze multi-hop relationships to identify
    coordinated fraud patterns such as fraud rings, account takeovers,
    and synthetic identities.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>3. Explain</b><br>
    When suspicious behavior is detected, a RAG-based explanation engine
    enriches alerts with historical context and natural language reasoning,
    enabling faster analyst decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Capabilities</h2>
  <p>
    ✔ Detection of hidden fraud rings and coordinated attacks<br>
    ✔ Reduced false positives through contextual graph analysis<br>
    ✔ Real-time alerting with confidence scoring<br>
    ✔ Explainable AI outputs for analyst trust and auditability
  </p>

  <h2>Designed for Scale</h2>
  <p>
    TRISHUL is built with scalability in mind, supporting high-throughput
    transaction environments and seamless integration into modern
    financial infrastructures.
